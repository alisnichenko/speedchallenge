My Take on the Comma AI Programming Challenge
======

TL;DR
-----

My goal is to predict the speed of a car from a video.

- data/train.mp4 is a video of driving containing 20400 frames. Video is shot at 20 fps.
- data/train.txt contains the speed of the car at each frame, one speed on each line.
- data/test.mp4 is a different driving video containing 10798 frames. Video is shot at 20 fps.
